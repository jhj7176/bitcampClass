update notice set no = no+1 where ref = 8 and no > nvl((select max(no) from notice where ref = 8 and lev =3), 2)

insert into notice (num, title, writer, wtime, content, ref, no, lev) values 
(notice_seq.nextval, '1-1-7', 'asdf', sysdate, '', 8,(nvl((select max(no) from notice where ref = 8 and lev =3), 2)+1 ), 3)
